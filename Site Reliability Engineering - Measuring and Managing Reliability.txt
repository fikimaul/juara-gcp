2. In this assignment you need to choose from a set of action items to prevent the recurrence of outages similar to the one described in this postmortem.
Postmortem: Blank Profile Pages!
Impact

From 08:43 to 13:17, users accessing their profile pages received incomplete responses. This rendered them unable to view or edit their profile.

Root Causes and Trigger
proximate root cause was a bug in the web server''s handling of unicode HTML templates. The trigger was commit a6d78d13, which changed the profile page template to support localization, but at the same time accidentally introduced unicode quotation marks (U+201C “, U+201D ”) into the template HTML. When the web server encountered these instead of the standard ascii quotation mark (U+0022 "), the template engine aborted rendering of the output.

Detection
Because the aborted rendering process did not throw an exception, the HTTP status code for the incomplete responses was still 200 OK. The problem thus went undetected by our SLO-based alerts. The support and social media teams manually escalated concerns about a substantially increased level of complaints relating to the profile page at 12:14.

Resolution
The web server was rolled back to the previous day''s build which did not contain the offending commit.

Lessons Learned
Things that went well:
Support/SM teams were able to find the correct escalation path and successfully contact ops team.
Our rollback procedures were executed quickly and resolved the problem.
Things that went poorly:
HTTP status code SLIs cannot detect incomplete responses.
Web server uses a severely outdated vendored version of the templating engine with substantially broken unicode support
Where we got lucky:
User profile page is relatively unimportant to our revenue stream.
Action Items
Review the proposed action items and use the TRUE/FALSE options to indicate if you agree that an action item should be implemented to prevent the outage described in this postmortem.
